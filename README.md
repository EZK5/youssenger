# Overview 👁️

'Youssenger' is a simplification of Meta's *Messenger*. Developed using **Next.js, React, Axios and Pusher**, Youssenger is a full-stack web application that features real-time chat functionality. Using **NextAuth.js**, Youssenger also employs user authentication and authorisation, with proper security measures like hashing passwords. All chat messages (including images), group chats, profile pictures are saved onto a server-side **MongoDB** database using Axios and updated in real time on the client-side using Pusher.

Feel free to check out a deployed demo [here](youssenger.vercel.app)!

# Disclaimers 🚫
This project was not aimed to make profit or steal intellectual property from Meta's *Messenger* in any way. It was simply a personal side project, undertaken to develop personal skills and learn new things.

Additionally, the website may be slow at times because of the multitude of API's required and also the lack of funding inputted to improve the website and database's performance so please **be patient!** In practice, all functionalities of 'Youssenger' work perfectly fine so either give it a few seconds or refresh the page if desperately needed 😃
